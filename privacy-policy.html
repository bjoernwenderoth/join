            <h2>Introduction and Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We have written this privacy policy (version 12.06.2024-112811287) in order to explain to you, in
                accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and applicable
                national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as controllers – and the processors commissioned
                by us (e.g. providers) – process, will process in the future and what lawful options you have. The terms
                used are to be understood in a gender-neutral way. In short, we provide you with comprehensive
                information about the data we process about you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal jargon. This privacy policy, however, aims
                to describe the most important things as simply and transparently as possible. To enhance transparency,
                technical terms are explained in a user-friendly manner, links to further information are provided, and
                graphics are used. We inform you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data within
                the scope of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not
                possible with the brief, unclear, and legally-technical explanations that are often standard on the
                internet when it comes to privacy. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and
                informative, and perhaps there is some information you did not know before. If you still have questions,
                we kindly ask you to contact the responsible entity mentioned below or in the imprint, follow the
                provided links, and view additional information on third-party sites. You can also find our contact
                details in the imprint.
            </p>

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
                This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by our company and to all personal data
                processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information as defined
                in Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as a person's name, email address, and postal address. The processing of
                personal data ensures that we can offer and bill for our services and products, whether online or
                offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="space">
                    <p>
                        All online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="space">
                    <p>
                        Social media presences and email communication
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="space">
                    <p>
                        Mobile apps for smartphones and other devices
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In short: This privacy policy applies to all areas where personal data is processed within the company
                through the aforementioned channels. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these
                channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.
            </p>

            <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
            <p>
                In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information about the legal principles
                and regulations, specifically the legal basis of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that
                allow us to process personal data.

                Regarding EU law, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of
                27 April 2016. You can, of course, read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex,
                the access to EU law, at <a
                    href="">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.
            </p>
            <p>We process your data only if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li class="space">
                    <h3>Consent </h3>
                    <p>(Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a
                        specific purpose. An example would be storing the data you entered into a contact form.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="space">
                    <h3>Contract </h3>
                    <p>(Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): To fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with
                        you, we process your data. For example, if we enter into a purchase contract with you, we need
                        personal information beforehand.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="space">
                    <h3>Legal obligation</h3>
                    <p>(Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your
                        data. For instance, we are legally obligated to retain invoices for accounting purposes. These
                        usually contain personal data.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="space">
                    <h3>Legitimate interests</h3>
                    <p>(Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not override
                        your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to
                        process certain data to securely and economically operate our website. This processing
                        constitutes a legitimate interest.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Additional conditions such as the performance of tasks carried out in the public interest or the
                exercise of official authority, as well as the protection of vital interests, generally do not apply to
                us. If such a legal basis should be relevant, it will be indicated at the appropriate point.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="space">
                    <p>
                        In Austria, this is the Federal Act concerning the Protection of Personal Data (Data Protection
                        Act), abbreviated as DSG.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="space">
                    <p>
                        In Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act, abbreviated as BDSG, applies.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If further regional or national laws are applicable, we will inform you about them in the following
                sections.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact Details of the Controller</h2>
            <p>
                Albin Schmid
                Sample Street 47, 12312 Sample City, Austria
            </p>

            <h2>Storage Duration</h2>
            <p>
                It is our general criterion to only store personal data for as long as it is absolutely necessary for
                the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the
                reason for data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obligated to retain certain
                data even after the original purpose has ceased, for example, for accounting purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent for data processing, the data will be
                deleted as soon as possible, provided there is no obligation to store it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will inform you below about the specific duration of each data processing, if we have further
                information on this matter.
            </p>

            <h2>Rights according to the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
            <p>In accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, we inform you about the following rights that you are
                entitled to, in order to ensure fair and transparent data processing:
            </p>
            <p>
                If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or if your data protection
                rights have been otherwise infringed, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In
                Austria, this authority is the Data Protection Authority, whose website you can find at <a
                    href="">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>
                . In Germany, there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For more
                information, you can contact the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
                (BfDI). For our company, the following local data protection authority is responsible:

            <h2>Explanation of Terms Used</h2>
            <p>
                We always strive to make our privacy policy as clear and understandable as possible. However, especially
                with technical and legal topics, this is not always easy. It often makes sense to use legal terms (such
                as personal data) or specific technical expressions (such as cookies, IP address). However, we do not
                want to use these without explanation. Below you will find an alphabetical list of important terms that
                we have used in our privacy policy, on which we may not have elaborated sufficiently. If these terms
                were taken from the GDPR and are definitions, we will also provide the GDPR texts here and, if
                necessary, add our own explanations.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Processor</h2>
            <h3>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</h3>
            <p>
                As a company and website owner, we are responsible for all data we process from you. In addition to us,
                who are the responsible entities, there may also be what are called data processors. This includes any
                company or person who processes personal data on our behalf. Data processors can, therefore, include
                service providers such as tax consultants, as well as hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter
                providers, or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.
            </p>

            <h2>Consent</h2>
            <h3>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</h3>
            <p>
                Typically, such consent on websites is obtained through a cookie consent tool. You're probably familiar
                with this. Whenever you visit a website for the first time, you're usually asked via a banner whether
                you consent to data processing. Often, you can also make individual settings and thus decide for
                yourself which data processing you allow and which you don't. If you do not consent, no personal data
                may be processed from you. In principle, consent can, of course, also be given in writing, not just
                through a tool.
            </p>

            <h2>Personal data</h2>
            <h3>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</h3>
            <p>
                Personenbezogene Daten sind also all jene Daten, die Sie als Person identifizieren können. Das sind in

            </ul>
            <p>
                According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), your IP address is also considered personal data. IT
                experts can determine at least the approximate location of your device based on your IP address and
                subsequently identify you as the subscriber. Therefore, storing an IP address also requires a legal
                basis under the GDPR. There are also so-called "special categories" of personal data that are
                particularly sensitive. These include:

            <h2>Profiling</h2>
            <h3>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</h3>
            <p>
                Profiling involves gathering various pieces of information about a person to gain deeper insights into
                that individual. In the online realm, profiling is often used for advertising purposes or credit
                assessments. Web or advertising analysis programs, for example, collect data about your behavior and
                interests on a website. This information is then used to create a specific user profile, which enables
                targeted advertising to be delivered to a particular audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                In our case, we are responsible for processing your personal data and thus the "Controller". When we
                transfer collected data to other service providers for processing, they are "Processors". For this, a
                "Data Processing Agreement (DPA)" must be signed.
